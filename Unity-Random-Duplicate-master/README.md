# Unity-Random-Duplicate
Small tool to random duplicate objects, useful when creating/designing levels by hand

# Usage
You can clone the repo on your machine and add the folder in your project, or just [download
the package](https://github.com/ibito/Unity-Random-Duplicate/raw/master/RandomDuplicate.unitypackage).

Go to `Window -> Random Duplicate -> Settings` to set your preferences, like:
- Scale on different axis
  - X
  - Y
  - Z

- Rotate randomly on different axis
  - X
  - Y
  - Z

- Set value for scale range

Now, with a selected **GameObject** go to `Window -> Random Duplicate -> Duplicate` or use `Ctrl (or Cmd in Mac) + Shift + D`
